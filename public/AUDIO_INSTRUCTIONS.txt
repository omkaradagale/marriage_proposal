To add your own romantic background music:

1. Find a romantic song/music (MP3 format recommended)
2. Rename it to: music.mp3
3. Place it in this folder (public/)
4. The app will automatically use it!

Recommended sources for royalty-free romantic music:
- Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/music/
- Free Music Archive: https://freemusicarchive.org/
- YouTube Audio Library (download as MP3)

If no local music.mp3 is found, the app will try to use an online fallback source.
